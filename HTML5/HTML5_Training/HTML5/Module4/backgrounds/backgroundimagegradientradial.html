the numbers following the radial declaration
determine the shape of the radius. The first two numbers dictate
the angle of the ellipse in degrees. The third number dictates the
size of the inner circle. The fourth and fifth numbers dictate the position of the gradient (left and top). The final number dictates
the final size of the radius.
