<p>HTML5 improves interoperability and reduces development costs by making precise rules on how to handle all HTML elements, and how to recover from errors.

<p>Some of the new features in HTML5 are functions for embedding audio, video, graphics, client-side data storage, and interactive documents. HTML5 also contains new elements like &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;figure&gt;.

<p>The HTML5 working group includes AOL, Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia, Opera, and many hundreds of other vendors.

<p>Note: HTML5 is not a W3C recommendation yet! 

<p>To read about the HTML5 activities at W3C, please read our W3C tutorial.

<p>HTML5 has several new input types for forms. These new features allow for better input control and validation.

<p>This chapter covers the new input types:

<p>email 
<p>url 
<p>number 
<p>range 
<p>Date pickers (date, month, week, time, datetime, datetime-local)
