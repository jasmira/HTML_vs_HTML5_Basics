		<h3>About Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam</h3>
		<article>
			<strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen "A. P. J." Abdul Kalam</strong> <em>(Born:
				5 October 1931 - 27 July 2015)</em> was the 11th President of India from
			2002 to 2007. A career scientist turned politician, Kalam was born
			and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and <em>Aerospace
				engineering</em>. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
			science administrator, mainly at the <em>Defence Research and
				Development Organisation (DRDO)</em> and <em>Indian Space Research
				Organisation (ISRO)</em> and was intimately involved in India's civilian
			space program and military missile development efforts. He thus came
			to be known as the <strong>Missile Man of India</strong> for his work
			on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
			technology. He also played a pivotal organizational, technical, and
			political role in India's <i>Pokhran-II</i> nuclear tests in 1998,
			the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

			Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the
			support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
			then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the <strong>"People's
				President"</strong>, he returned to his civilian life of education, writing
			and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several
			prestigious awards, including the <strong>Bharat Ratna</strong>,
			India's highest civilian honour.

			While delivering a lecture at the <small><b>Indian
					Institute of Management Shillong</b></small>, Kalam collapsed and died from an
			apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands including
			national-level dignitaries attended the funeral ceremony held in his
			hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
